## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 (uv can install this in its our venv for you)
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation) installed

### Installation/Setup

- Make sure to set all required environment variables, see `.env.example` and `src/csse3200bot/config.py`.

- For dev, `docker compose up` will probably be your go to.
- Otherwise, you can use the provided Dockerfile to build the image for the bot and host it as you like.


### Deployment
- Currently GitHub Actions is used to build the docker image and then publish that to a container registry. I then have [fluxcd](https://fluxcd.io/) setup on my homelab to automatically update the k8s manifest with the new container image.
